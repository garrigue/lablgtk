             LablGTK3 3.0.beta4 : an interface to the GIMP Tool Kit

Needed:
        ocaml-4.05 or more
        gtk+-3.18 or more
        findlib 1.2.1 or more (for default install)
        GNU make (there is no standard for conditionals)

Status:
  LablGtk3 is still an experimental port of LablGtk2 to Gtk-3.
  Currently it is more or less a subset of LablGtk2.

  An important change in gtk-2 was the use of unicode (utf8) for
  all strings. If you use non-ascii strings, you must imperatively
  convert them to unicode. This can be done with the
  [Glib.Convert.locale_to_utf8] function. If your input is already in
  utf8, it is still a good idea to validate it with
  Glib.Utf8.validate, as malformed utf8 strings may cause segmentation
  faults.
  Note that setlocale is now always called (except if you set
  GTK_SETLOCALE to 0 in the environment), but LC_NUMERIC is reverted
  to "C" to avoid problems with floating point conversion in Caml.

  Some widgets may be unsupported on your version of Gtk.
  If you use them, you will get a runtime error:
    Failure "Gobject.unsafe_create : type GtkActionGroup is not yet defined"
  For unsupported methods, the error message is a bit clearer:
    Failure "gdk_pixbuf_get_file_info unsupported in Gtk 2.x < 2.4"

How to compile:

  There are two ways to compile: dune or make.

  For dune, just do "dune build && dune install".
  If you want also to build examples, do "dune build @all".

  The following details the instructions for make.

  You should normally not need to modify Makefiles.

  In case you are using the SVN version you may have to first type
  "aclocal && autoconf".

  Type
        ./configure && make world
  to compile with all supported options enabled (libgl,
  libgnomecanvas, librsvg, native compilation, thread support).

  You may use "./configure --help" to check for the different
  configuration options.

  Lablgtk3 specific options are:

        --with-libdir=/path: install libs in /path/lablgtk3
                             and /path/stublibs
        --with-gtkspell --without-gtkspell:
                override autodetected gtkspell support
        --with-gtksourceview3 --without-gtksourceview3:
                override autodetected gtksourceview3 support
        --enable-debug: enable debug mode

  Type "make install" to install using findlib.
  The commands lablgtk3, gdk_pixbuf_mlsource3, and lablgladecc3,
  are copied directly to the configured executable directory.

  The following findlib packages are provided (according to configuration):

        lablgtk3
        lablgtk3.auto-init
        lablgtk3.gtkspell
        lablgtk3.sourceview3

  You can alternatively use "make old-install" or
  "make old-install DESTDIR=/my/prefix" to use the old
  installation procedure, which does not rely on findlib.
  By default, the library is installed at +lablgtk3.
  All installation paths are prefixed by DESTDIR when given.

        gtk.ml          low-level interface to the GIMP Tool Kit
        gtkThread.ml    main loop for threaded version
        g[A-Z]*.ml      object-oriented interface to GTK
        gdkObj.ml       object-oriented interface to GDK

        lablgtk3        toplevel

        examples/*.ml   various examples

        applications/browser    an ongoing port of ocamlbrowser
        applications/camlirc    an IRC client (by Nobuaki Yoshida)

How to run the examples:
  In the examples directory just type:
        lablgtk3 ???.ml

  If you want to run them before installing lablgtk3 you have to use -localdir:
        ../src/lablgtk3 -localdir ???.ml

How to link them:
  The lablgtk3 script loads an extra module GtkInit, whose only contents is:
        let locale = GtkMain.Main.init ()
  You must either add this line, or add this module to your link, before
  calling any Gtk function. With ocamlfind, use
        ocamlfind ocamlc -package lablgtk3.auto-init -linkpkg -w s ???.ml -o ???
  Otherwise, use something similar to:
        ocamlc -I +lablgtk3 -w s lablgtk.cma gtkInit.cmo ???.ml -o ???

How to use the threaded toplevel:

        % lablgtk3 -thread
                Objective Caml version 4.07.1

        # let w = GWindow.window ~show:true ();;
        # let b = GButton.button ~packing:w#add ~label:"Hello!" ();;

  You should at once see a window appear, and then a button.
  The GTK main loop is running in a separate thread. Any command
  is immediately reflected by the system.
  For Windows and OSX/Quartz, there are restrictions on which
  commands can be used in which thread. See the windows port section
  lower for how to use them.

  When using threads in a stand-alone application, you must link with
  gtkThread.cmo and call GtkThread.main in place of GMain.main.

  Since 2.16.0, busy waiting is no longer necessary with systems
  threads. (I.e., CPU usage is 0% if nothing occurs.)
  If you use VM threads, you have to enable busy waiting by hand,
  otherwise other threads won't be executed (cf. gtkThread.mli).
  Beware that with VM threads, you cannot switch threads within
  a callback. The only thread related command you may use in a
  callback is Thread.create. Calling blocking operations may cause
  deadlocks. On the other hand, all newly created threads will be run
  outside of the callback, so they can use all thread operations.

Structure of the (raw) Gtk* modules:

  These modules are composed of one submodule for each class.
  Signals specific to a widget are in a Signals inner module.
  A setter function is defined to give access to set_param functions.

Structure of the G[A-Z]* modules:

  These modules provide classes to wrap the raw function calls.
  Here are the widget classes contained in each module:

  GPango        Pango font handling
  GDraw         Gdk pixmaps, etc...
  GObj          gtkobj, widget, style
  GData         data, adjustment, tooltips
  GContainer    container, item_container
  GWindow       window, dialog, color_selection_dialog, file_selection, plug
  GPack         box, button_box, table, fixed, layout, packer, paned, notebook
  GBin          scrolled_window, event_box, handle_box, frame,
                aspect_frame, viewport, socket
  GButton       button, toggle_button, check_button, radio_button, toolbar
  GMenu         menu_item, tearoff_item, check_menu_item, radio_menu_item,
                menu_shell, menu, option_menu, menu_bar, factory
  GMisc         separator, statusbar, calendar, drawing_area,
                misc, arrow, image, pixmap, label, tips_query,
                color_selection, font_selection
  GTree         tree_item, tree, view (also tree/list_store, model)
  GList         list_item, liste, clist
  GEdit         editable, entry, spin_button, combo
  GRange        progress, progress_bar, range, scale, scrollbar
  GText         view (also buffer, iter, mark, tag, tagtable)

  While subtyping follows the Gtk widget hierarchy, you cannot always
  use width subtyping (i.e. #super is not unifiable with all the
  subclasses of super). Still, it works for some classes, like
  #widget and #container, and allows subtyping without coercion towards
  these classes (cf. #container in examples/pousse.ml for instance).

  Practically, each widget class is composed of:
  * a coerce method, returning the object coerced to the type widget.
  * an as_widget method, returning the raw Gtk widget used for packing, etc...
  * a destroy method, sending the destroy signal to the object.
  * a get_oid method, the equivalent of Oo.id for Gtk objects.
  * a connect sub-object, allowing one to widget specific
    signals (this is what prevents width subtyping in subclasses.)
  * a misc sub-object, giving access to miscellanous functionality of
    the basic gtkwidget class, and a misc#connect sub-object.
  * an event sub-object, for Xevent related functions (only if the widget
    has an Xwindow), and an event#connect sub-object.
  * a drag  sub-object, containing drag and drop functions,
    and a drag#connect sub-object.
  * widget specific methods.

  Here is a diagram of the structure (- for methods, + for sub-objects)
        - coerce : widget
        - as_widget : Gtk.widget obj
        - destroy : unit -> unit
        - get_oid : int
        - ...
        + connect : mywidget_signals
        |   - after
        |   - signal_name : callback:(... -> ...) -> GtkSignal.id
        + misc : misc_ops
        |   - show, hide, disconnect, ...
        |   + connect : misc_signals
        + drag : drag_ops
        |   - ...
        |   + connect : drag_signals
        + event : event_ops
        |   - add, ...
        |   + connect : event_signals

  You create a widget by [<Module>.<widget name> options ... ()].
  Many optional arguments are admitted. The last two of them, packing:
  and show:, allow you respectively to call a function on your newly
  created widget, and to decide wether to show it immediately or not.
  By default all widgets except toplevel windows (GWindow module) are
  shown immediately.

Default arguments:
  For many constructor or method arguments, default values are provided.
  Generally, this default value is defined by GTK, and you must refer
  to GTK's documentation.
  For ML defined defaults, usually default values are either false, 0, None
  or `NONE, according to the expected type.
  Important exceptions are ~show, which default to true in all widgets
  except those in GWindow, and ~fill, which defaults to true or `BOTH.

Note about unit as method argument:

  O'Caml introduces no distinction between methods having side-effects
  and methods simply returning a value. In practice, this is
  confusing, and awkward when used as callbacks. For this reason all
  methods having noticeable side-effects should take arguments, and
  unit if they have no argument.

ML-side signals:

  The GUtil module provides two kinds of utilities: a memo table, to be
  able to dynamically cast widgets to their original class, and more
  interesting ML-side signals.
  With ML-side signals, you can combine LablGTK widgets into your own
  components, and add signals to them. Later you can connect to these
  signals, just like GTK signals. This proved very efficient to
  develop complex applications, abstracting the plumbing between
  various components. Explanations are provided in GUtil.mli.

Contributed components:

  The GToolbox module contains contributed components to help you build
  your applications.

Memory management:

  Important efforts have been dedicated to cooperate with Gtk's
  reference counting mechanism. As a result you should generally be
  able to use Gdk/Gtk data structures without caring about memory
  management. They will be freed when nobody points to them any more.
  This also means that you do not need to pay too much attention to
  whether a data structure is still alive or not. If it is not, you
  should get an error rather than a core dump.
  The case of Gtk objects deserves special care. Since they are
  interactive, we cannot just destroy them when they are no longer
  referenced. They have to be explicitely destroyed. If a widget was
  added to a container widget, it will automatically be destroyed when
  its last container is destroyed. For this reason you need only
  destroy toplevel widgets.

  Since too frequent GC can severely degrade performance, since 2.18.4
  it is possible to change the contribution of custom blocks to the
  GC cycle, using the function GMain.Gc.set_speed. The default is 10%
  of what it was in 2.18.3. If you set it to 0, custom block allocation
  has no impact, and you should consider running the Gc by hand.

  IMPORTANT: Some Gtk data structures are allocated in the Caml heap,
  and their use in signals (Gtk functions internally cally callbacks)
  relies on their address being stable during a function call. For
  this reason automatic compation is disabled in GtkMain. If you need
  it, you may use compaction through Gc.compact where it is safe
  (timeouts, other threads...), but do not enable automatic compaction.

LibGlade support: not available in Gtk3 (replaced by GtkBuilder)
GL extension: not available in Gtk3
SVG support: not available in Gtk3
GnomeCanvas support: not available in Gtk3
GtkSourceView 3 support:
  This binding was contributed by Benjamin Monate, and
  adapted by Hugo Herbelin.
  It requires libgtksourceview-3.x.
  See examples in examples/sourceview/*2.ml
  The executable must be linked with lablgtksourceview3.cma.

Windows port

  See README.win32 for detailed information on installation.

  If you want to use threads, you must be aware of windows specific
  restrictions; see for instance:
     http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.gimp.windows.devel/314
  I.e. all GTK related calls must occur in the same thread, the one
  that runs the main loop. If you want to call them from other threads
  you need to do some forwarding. Fortunately, with a functional
  language this is easy. Two functions,
    val async : ('a -> unit) -> 'a -> unit
    val sync : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b
  are available in the GtkThread module to help you. They will forward
  your call to the main thread (between handling two GUI events). This
  can be either asynchronous or synchronous. In the synchronous case,
  beware of deadlocks (the trivial case, when you are calling from the
  same thread, is properly avoided). Note also that since callbacks
  are always called from the main loop thread, you can freely use GTK
  in them. Also, non-graphical operations are thread-safe.
  Here is an example using the lablgtk toplevel with threads:
        % lablgtk3.bat -thread
                Objective Caml version 4.07.1

        # open GtkThread;;
        # let w = sync (GWindow.window ~show:true) ();;
        # let b = sync (GButton.button ~packing:w#add ~label:"Hello!") ();;
        # b#connect#clicked (fun () -> prerr_endline "Hello");;

OSX/Quartz port

  Since Darwin is Unix, this port compiles as usual.
  Note however that Quartz imposes even stronger restrictions than
  Windows on threads: only the main thread of the application can do
  GUI work. Just apply the same techniques as described above, being
  careful to ensure that your first call to GtkThread.main occurs in
  the main thread. This is done automatically in the threaded toplvel.
