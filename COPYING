This library is made available under the LGPL, with the same exception
as specified in the Objective Caml distribution, to allow freely static
linking.
You should have got a copy of the LGPL and this exception with
Objective Caml.
This modified LGPL applies to all the files in the src/ directory, but
not in other directories.

For the examples subdirectory, there is no specific licensing policy,
but you may freely take inspiration from the code, and copy parts of
it in your application.

For the applications subdirectory, stricter rules apply:

* You are free to do anything you want with this code as long as it is
  for personal use.

* Redistribution can only be "as is".  Binary distribution and bug
  fixes are allowed, but you cannot extensively modify the code
  without asking the authors.

The authors may choose to remove any of the above restrictions on a
per request basis.
