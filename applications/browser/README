	Browser: the beginning of a port of the OCamlBrowser

Installation:

* make a link from a directory where the O'Caml distribution is
  compiled to ocaml-src
	ln -s /path/to/ocaml-3.12 ocaml-src
  (actually only the directory parsing needs to be compiled)

* just type "make"

Use:

When you run browser, you just get a customized editor with lexical
coloring. Nothing very fancy.
In the file menu you can open a shell, running ocaml as subprocess.
