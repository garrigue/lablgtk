		LablGTK : an interface to the GIMP Tool Kit


Needed:
	olabl-2.02 Summer edition (olabl-2.02-summer.tar.gz)
	gtk-1.2.x
	gmake (there is no standard for conditionals)

How to compile:

	You should normally not need to modify Makefiles.
	First type "make configure <options>".
	Options are
		USE_CC=1	to use $(CC) rather than gcc
		USE_GL=1	to compile with OpenGL support (see lower)
		MESA=Mesa	to link with Mesa libs rather than OpenGL

	Then just type "make" to build the library and toplevel.
	Also type "make lablgtk_t" to make the threaded toplevel.

	On FreeBSD, you need to link with libxpg4.so for Japanese
	output.

Contents:

	gdk.ml		low-level interface to the General Drawing Kit
	gtk.ml		low-level interface to the GIMP Tool Kit
	gtkThread.ml	main loop for threaded version
	g[A-Z]*.ml	object-oriented interface to GTK
	gdkObj.ml	object-oriented interface to GDK

	lablgtk		normal toplevel
	lablgtk_t	threaded toplevel

	examples/*.ml	various examples
	applications/*	application using the library
		radtest		a very experimental RAD for lablgtk
		lablglade	another experimental RAD, based on glade

	lablgl.patch	patch for lablgl-0.92

How to run the examples:

	./lablgtk examples/???.ml

  some examples (e.g. buttons.ml) may need to be run from the examples
  directory

	../lablgtk -I .. ???.ml

How to use the threaded toplevel:

	% ./lablgtk_t
	        Objective Caml version 2.02 with Kyoto labels and variants
	
	# let id = GtkThread.start ();;
	val id : Thread.t = <abstr>

  The GTK main loop is now running in a separate thread. Any command
  is immediately reflected by the system.
  Beware that you cannot switch threads within a callback, that is the
  only thread related command you may use in a callback is
  Thread.create. On the other hand, all newly created threads will be
  run directly by the caml main loop, so they can use all thread
  operations.

Structure of the (raw) Gtk* modules:

  These modules are composed of one submodule for each class.
  Signals specific to a widget are in a Signals inner module.
  A setter function is defined to give access to set_param functions.

Structure of the G[A-Z]* modules:

  These modules provide classes to wrap the raw function calls.

  While subtyping follows the Gtk widget hierarchy, you cannot always
  use width subtyping (i.e. #super is not unifiable with all the
  subclasses of super). Still, it works for the gtkobj, widget and
  container classes, and allows subtyping without coercion towards
  these classes (cf. #container in pousse.ml for instance).

  Practically, each widget class is composed of:
  * an as_widget method, returning the Gtk widget used for packing, etc...
  * a misc sub-object, giving access to miscellanous functionality of
    the basic gtkwidget class
  * a connect sub-object, allowing one to connect all available
    signals (this is what prevents width subtyping in subcases)
  * a connect#event sub-object, for event signals

  You create a widget by [new <widget name> options ...].
  Many optional arguments are admitted. The two last of them, packing:
  and show:, allow you respectively to call a function on your newly
  created widget, and to decide wether to show it immediately or not.
  By default all widgets except toplevel windows are shown
  immediately.

Note about unit as method argument:

  O'Caml introduces no distinction between methods having side-effects
  and methods simply returning a value. In practice, this is
  confusing, and awkward when used as callbacks. For this reason all
  methods having noticeable side-effects should take arguments, and
  unit if they have no argument.

Memory management:

  Important efforts have been dedicated to cooperate with Gtk's
  reference counting mechanism. As a result you should generally be
  able to use Gdk/Gtk data structures without caring about memory
  management. They will be freed when nobody points to them any more.
  This also means that you do not need to pay too much attention to
  whether a data structure is still alive or not. If it is not, you
  should get an error rather than a core dump.
  The case of Gtk objects deserves special care. Since they are
  interactive, we cannot just destroy them when they are no longer
  referenced. They have to be explicitely destroyed. If a widget was
  added to a container widget, it will automatically be destroyed when
  its last container is destroyed. For this reason you should only
  destroy toplevel widgets.

GL extension

  You can use lablgtk in combination with LablGL

  * apply lablgl.patch to lablgl-0.92, compile and install
  * get and install gtkglarea-1.2.x.tar.gz from
    http://www.student.oulu.fi/~jlof/gtkglarea/index.html
  * reconfigure: "make configure USE_GL=1"
  * if you use Mesa, then "make configure USE_GL=1 MESA=Mesa"

  Some examples are in examples/GL, but basically any LablGL example
  can be easily ported.
